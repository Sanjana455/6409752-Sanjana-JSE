# Difference Between JPA, Hibernate, and Spring Data JPA

## Introduction

In Java applications that interact with relational databases, developers often use ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) to simplify database operations. Three commonly encountered technologies are:

- JPA (Java Persistence API)
- Hibernate
- Spring Data JPA

While they are closely related, each serves a different purpose in the application development stack.

---

## 1. Java Persistence API (JPA)

- JPA is a specification provided by Java EE.
- It defines how Java objects are mapped to database tables.
- It does not provide an implementation â€” it needs a provider (like Hibernate or EclipseLink).
- JPA uses annotations like `@Entity`, `@Id`, and queries via JPQL.

---

## 2. Hibernate

- Hibernate is the most popular JPA provider.
- It is a full-fledged ORM framework and also implements JPA.
- It provides additional features beyond JPA, such as:
  - HQL (Hibernate Query Language)
  - Caching support
  - Lazy and eager loading options
- Hibernate can be used standalone or as the JPA provider in frameworks like Spring.

##  3. Spring Data JPA

- Spring Data JPA is a module of the Spring Framework built on top of JPA.
- It abstracts JPA and Hibernate complexities by providing repository interfaces.
- No need to write boilerplate code like `EntityManager` or even query definitions.
- Just define method names like `findByName()` and Spring auto-generates the queries.
